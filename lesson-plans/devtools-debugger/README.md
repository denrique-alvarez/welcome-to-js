# DevTools Debugger

Practice using different features in your browser's DevTools Debugger to
understand interactive JS programs.

---

## Prep Work

- from `javascript.info`: [DevTools](https://javascript.info/devtools),
  [Debugging Chrome](https://javascript.info/debugging-chrome)
- Study
  [/3-understanding-programs/1-predicting-execution](../../3-understanding-programs/1-predicting-execution/?--defaults)
  - `devtool-setup.mp4`
  - `guide.mp4`
  - the JS files

## Learning Objectives

- 🥚 **Stepping Through**: You can use the _Step_ button to go through a program
  one statement at a time, pausing an any line you want to inspect.
- 🥚 **Scope Panel**: You can use the _Scope_ panel in your debugger to find the
  value of all active variables at step of execution, including when a variable
  is _uninitialized_.
- 🥚 **Continue to Here**: When paused in the debugger, you can skip the
  program's execution to a specific line using the "continue to here" option.
- 🥚 **Breakpoints**: Once in the Debugger, you can set and unset breakpoints to
  skip ahead to specific lines. You can also set and unset breakpoints within a
  line when possible.
- 🥚 **Hovering Previews**: You can preview the value of any expression or
  initialized variable in your program, including parts of a longer expression.
- 🐣 **Error State**: You can inspect your program's _state_ (values in _Scope_)
  when an error occurs, this includes the values of every active variable at the
  moment the error occurred. (your Debugger must be configured to pause on
  exceptions.)
- 🐣 **Watch Expressions**: You can track the value of any expression at any
  step of execution using the _Watch_ panel.
- 🐥 **Logpoints**: You can create helpful logpoints to print a trace of the
  program's execution while you are stepping through in the Debugger.
- 🐥 **Conditional Breakpoints**: You can create conditional breakpoints in your
  code so the debugger pauses on a specific line _only_ if the condition is
  true.
- 🐔 **`debugger` Statement**: You understand the difference between `debugger`
  and a breakpoint, and can write a `debugger` statement in your source code to
  pause the program before specific lines.
- 🐔 **Nested Scopes**: You can predict what will be displayed in the Scope
  panel for different steps of a program with nested scopes.

## During Class

Follow the instructions in the exercise programs to explore your DevTool's
Debugger. Do lots of searching online when you don't understand the Debugger,
and when you don't understand the JS in the program:

**Before Break**

- **All Together**: Study programs 1-3 with a coach sharing their screen
- **In Small Groups**: Study programs 4-9. No problem if you don't finish them
  all now!

**Break!**

**After Break**

- **In Small Groups**: Continue studying programs 4-9. Try to master through
  program #7 and start #8 if possible.
- **All Together** Regroup with ~20 minutes left at the end of class for each
  group to present:
  - what went well?
  - what went less well?
  - lessons learned

## After Class

No deliverables. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Here's some ideas
for what to focus on after this lesson:

- Continue studying your favorite online tutorials
- Finish studying `/2-just-enough-javascript` if you haven't yet
- Study `/3-understanding-programs`
- `/0-flashcards`: ~20 minutes every day (add more cards as you go!)
