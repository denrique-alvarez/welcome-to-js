/* üê• Logpoints

  logpoints are like writing `console.log` in your code
    except they are defined in your Debugger, not the source code
  it's like `debugger` statements vs. breakpoints

  first practice placing logpoints in this program to trace each variable

  anything you can write in `console.log`, you can write in a logpoint!
    play around with logpoints after you've finished the suggested ones
